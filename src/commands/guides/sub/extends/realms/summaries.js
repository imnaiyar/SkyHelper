The floor begins with Cosmic Mantas circulating the platform, which players can ride up to reach the Summit, or wait for the elevator to slowly rise up. Differing from all the previous floors, this floor is mostly natural, with a stone island with grass comprising the whole area. Surrounding the Elder's altar is the previous realm's altars: from Isle to Wasteland.

          "Eye of Eden is the penultimate Realm in the game (behind Orbit). It features many dangers (namely rock rain, Dark Dragons, and polluted water) that can remove the player's <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light. Eye of Eden shows the most signs of ruin and destruction of any Realm.\n\nEye of Eden used to come with a warning, and TGC has tried very hard to encourage (even mandate) that multiple players are needed in order to navigate and complete this Realm. Indeed, multiple players can be beneficial, and veteran players can definitely help new players. Friends help to keep your Cape charged and can also provide encouragement along the way. If you have Warp open with friends, it can be utilized very effectively throughout the difficult portions of the Eye of Eden.\n\nStronger or more experienced players can also help newer players (with less Cape Power) through the Eye of Eden in this way. But unlike previous versions of this final Realm of the game, each player does have to do the hardest work themselves, and be prepared to sacrifice everything.\n\n*Source: [Eye_of_Eden](<https://sky-children-of-the-light.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Eden>)*",

            "This is the safest and easiest part of the Realm, and gives you an idea of some of the strategy that will be used later on. It is always advised to play with sound on in Eden, as it will give players specific cues. There are several shortcuts to take here, though one of them is only possible for truly accomplished fliers.\n\n**Shortcuts**\n- Shortcut 1: Go down to the floor of the first area, above which the rocks will be flying. By crossing over to the other side, players will find a climbable ledge. If ascended, players will find themselves past the streaming rocks – almost at the first lantern.\n- Shortcut 2 (five Wedges minimum): Truly daring players can use the powerful wind to fly directly up towards the entrance into the next section, where a Child of Light is standing. This is done by first activating open-winged flight at takeoff, flying against the wind in a diagonal manner, and letting the wind push the avatar back to land at the target location. However, this shortcut takes a huge amount of practice to master even for very experienced players. There are guide videos to find on Youtube.\n\n*Source: [Eye_of_Eden#Section_1:_Wind_and_Rocks](<https://sky-children-of-the-light.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Eden#Section_1:_Wind_and_Rocks>)*",

            "This part of the Realm adds more challenge in the form of Dark Dragons (Krill) who patrol the pathway. Between wind and flying rocks, you will have to listen and time your moves wisely.\n\nThese first two sections are where an ability like Warp can be very useful between friends, especially if a veteran player wants to help a newer player with less cape power or skill.\n\nThis second section is broken into two parts. The lower section is patrolled by two Dark Dragons and can be a bit of a puzzle to navigate. When at the stairs depicted in the map to the right, players may fly without being blown back. Past the two first Dark Dragons, there is a large circular cave with Dark Crabs that may harm you while recharging your light. The upper section is a battlefield, with frozen soldiers, trenches, and fortifications. There is also a Dark Dragon who patrols the very top of the hill before the last hallway. A suggested route can be found at the bottom of the page under Other Resources.\n\n__**WARNING:**__ Once you pass through the transition at the end of the Hallway, you are in Storm Lock. This means that you must finish Eye of Eden before you will be able to enter any other Realm again. If you manually close the app, you will find yourself in Home Space with dark and inaccessible portals – you have crossed the point of no return.\n\n*Source: [Eye_of_Eden#Section_2:_Dark_Dragons_and_the_Battlefield](<https://sky-children-of-the-light.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Eden#Section_2:_Dark_Dragons_and_the_Battlefield>)*",

The Statues are in the form of Sky Kids shrouded in Darkness. By depositing your <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light with them, you are, in essence, saving them while causing yourself to grow weaker.

This is part of the process. As you deposit <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light at each Statue, your Cape Power will decrease. However, the more <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light you deposit, the more rewards you will receive. Each Statue you free will grant you approximately 0.25 of an ascended candle. You can use these rewards to unlock Wing Buffs in Spirit Shops (including Travelling Spirits), and eventually increase the starting number of Cape Wedges in your meter. The next time you die, your Wing Buffs you will give you extra winged lights. Unlike in previous versions of Eye of Eden, there is no surviving. There is only one outcome.
