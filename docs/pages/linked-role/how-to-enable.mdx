The most simplified way to enable linked role connection with SkyHelper is by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open your server settings dropdown.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to the `Roles` tab.
- **Step 3:** Create a new `Role` and give it a name or select an existing one.
- **Step 4:** Under role settings, click `Link` option.

# What does it mean to enable an option as shown in the image above?

<Callout type="warning">We recommend not enabling any of the options if you don't want to complicate the process</Callout>

When you enable an option, that means the user's must meet the requirements for that option to get the role. For example let's say
you have enabled the `Max Wings` and set the requirement to 32 wings. When a user tries to get the role and while authenticating
with the bot, they provide 31 as their max wings, they wouldn't be able to get the role as they didn't meet the threshold set by
you. Due to how linked role connection works, we (the bot developer) cannot control if an admin can enable or disable the options requirement.

How each option works if enabled:

- **Max Wings:** The user must have the number of wings equal to or greater than the number set by you.
- **Sky Bday**: The user must be playing the game earlier than the no. of days set by you.
- **CR Run/Eden/Hangout**: If any one of them is enabled, the user must have that as their preferences to get the role.

In a way, if you want advanced settings, this can be way to control which users can get the role and have it behave the way you want.

<Callout type="info">
  All this info is provided by the user. When they try to get the role, Discord will redirect users to bot's dashboard where they
  will be authenticated with discord. Once that's done, users will be presented to provide their preferences and then that
  preference is sent to discord. Discord will then validate and if it meets the requirements, users will be able to get the role.
  Again that means user's can provide any value, even if you set a requirement, there's no way for us to validate if the provided
  info was correct. You can update your Sky profile anytime by visiting [here](https://dash.skyhelper.xyz/user/linked-role).
