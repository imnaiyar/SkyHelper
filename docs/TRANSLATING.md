# Translating SkyHelper

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the localization of SkyHelper! This guide will help you understand how to translate the bot's commands and messages into different languages.

## Guidelines for Translating

1. **Consistency**: Ensure that the translation is consistent with the original meaning. If you're unsure about the context, feel free to ask for clarification in the [Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/2rjCRKZsBb).

2. **Application Command Names and Options**:
    - **No Uppercase**: Command names and options should not contain uppercase letters.
    - **No Spaces**: Command and options names (only "names") should not contain spaces. Use underscores `_` or hyphens `-` if necessary.


4. **Proofreading**: Some languages are initially translated using AI. These translations need to be proofread and corrected to ensure accuracy and naturalness. Check tasklists on crowdin page for languages that needs proofreading

## Tips for Translating

- Maintain the original formatting and placeholders (e.g., `{{TIME}}`, `{{DURATION}}`), these should not be translated and are meant to be a placeholder for stuffs that are added based on the context.
- Test your translations if possible to ensure they fit well within the application context.
