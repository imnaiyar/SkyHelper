Instead of indicating Ancestor Spirits, this one mandates a certain number of <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light. You can enter the Eye of Eden only after you have completed all the previous Realms (watched the Elder cutscenes) and collected at least 20 <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light. However, much like the Spirit Gates, the <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light requirement can be bypassed by holding hands with a friend who has met it, although this is not recommended.\n\n> *Note: The 20 <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light will not be used for flight, but for sacrifice. Players who successfully bring large amounts (>63) of <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light through Eden will be handsomely rewarded with ascended candles.*\n\nMultiple players are no longer required to open the door to Eden. There are still five buttons to light, but they can be lit by a single person. That said, having a group of friends together in the final area (4th Page) can help you all to maximize the rewards you receive in Orbit.\n\n*Source: [Eye_of_Eden#Entering_Eye_of_Eden](<https://sky-children-of-the-light.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Eden#Entering_Eye_of_Eden>)*",

        description:
          "This is the safest and easiest part of the Realm, and gives you an idea of some of the strategy that will be used later on. It is always advised to play with sound on in Eden, as it will give players specific cues. There are several shortcuts to take here, though one of them is only possible for truly accomplished fliers.\n\n**Shortcuts**\n- Shortcut 1: Go down to the floor of the first area, above which the rocks will be flying. By crossing over to the other side, players will find a climbable ledge. If ascended, players will find themselves past the streaming rocks – almost at the first lantern.\n- Shortcut 2 (five Wedges minimum): Truly daring players can use the powerful wind to fly directly up towards the entrance into the next section, where a Child of Light is standing. This is done by first activating open-winged flight at takeoff, flying against the wind in a diagonal manner, and letting the wind push the avatar back to land at the target location. However, this shortcut takes a huge amount of practice to master even for very experienced players. There are guide videos to find on Youtube.\n\n*Source: [Eye_of_Eden#Section_1:_Wind_and_Rocks](<https://sky-children-of-the-light.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Eden#Section_1:_Wind_and_Rocks>)*",

          "This part of the Realm adds more challenge in the form of Dark Dragons (Krill) who patrol the pathway. Between wind and flying rocks, you will have to listen and time your moves wisely.\n\nThese first two sections are where an ability like Warp can be very useful between friends, especially if a veteran player wants to help a newer player with less cape power or skill.\n\nThis second section is broken into two parts. The lower section is patrolled by two Dark Dragons and can be a bit of a puzzle to navigate. When at the stairs depicted in the map to the right, players may fly without being blown back. Past the two first Dark Dragons, there is a large circular cave with Dark Crabs that may harm you while recharging your light. The upper section is a battlefield, with frozen soldiers, trenches, and fortifications. There is also a Dark Dragon who patrols the very top of the hill before the last hallway. A suggested route can be found at the bottom of the page under Other Resources.\n\n__**WARNING:**__ Once you pass through the transition at the end of the Hallway, you are in Storm Lock. This means that you must finish Eye of Eden before you will be able to enter any other Realm again. If you manually close the app, you will find yourself in Home Space with dark and inaccessible portals – you have crossed the point of no return.\n\n*Source: [Eye_of_Eden#Section_2:_Dark_Dragons_and_the_Battlefield](<https://sky-children-of-the-light.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Eden#Section_2:_Dark_Dragons_and_the_Battlefield>)*",

          "In this section, rocky rain does not let up. You run through the area finding Statues at which you deposit your <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light. The Statues are in the form of Sky Kids shrouded in Darkness. By depositing your <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light with them, you are, in essence, saving them while causing yourself to grow weaker. The more <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light you bring into this section, the more frozen Sky Kids you can reach before running out – the more you are rewarded later.\n\nAs you carefully navigate Zone 1 on the map seen on the right side of the page, listen closely to the audio cues. The red rain will have a sound of crystals shattering, which signifies that it is not safe to move. When entering the continuous red rain: avoid jumping (as it will knock you down) and use the deep call feature to help friends hang onto their <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light just a while longer.\n\n ## Sacrifice\nYou will lose all your <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light in Eye of Eden. This is part of the process. As you deposit <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light at each Statue, your Cape Power will decrease. However, the more <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light you deposit, the more rewards you will receive. Each Statue you free will grant you approximately 0.25 of an ascended candle. You can use these rewards to unlock Wing Buffs in Spirit Shops (including Travelling Spirits), and eventually increase the starting number of Cape Wedges in your meter. The next time you die, your Wing Buffs you will give you extra winged lights. Unlike in previous versions of Eye of Eden, there is no surviving. There is only one outcome. The goal is to deposit as many <:SkyWingbuff:1205939379206488114> Winged Light as you can before you lose all of your power and die.\n\n*Source: [Eye_of_Eden#Section_3:_Statues_and_Winged_Light](<https://sky-children-of-the-light.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Eden#Section_3:_Statues_and_Winged_Light>)*",
