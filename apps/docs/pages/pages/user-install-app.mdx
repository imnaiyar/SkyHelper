# User-installable App

Discord has recently introduced a feature that allows users to install bots directly to their user accounts. This enables you to access the bot's commands across all Discord contexts: direct messages (DMs), group DMs (GDMs), and even servers where the bot isn't a member.

SkyHelper fully supports user installations, allowing you to use nearly all its commands seamlessly. However, some commands require the bot to be present in a server to function correctly. For details on which commands are server-specific, please refer to the [Commands](/commands) page.

## How to Install SkyHelper

Adding SkyHelper to your user account is quick and easy, similar to adding it to a serverâ€”though the process slightly differs. Follow these steps:

<Steps>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore --> */}
  ### Open the bot's profile and click the "Add App" button, or you can use this [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1121541967730450574) to get started.

You can now access SkyHelper's commands anywhere, either through the `App Launcher` or by typing `/` in any chat.
