# Translating SkyHelper

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the localization of SkyHelper! This guide will help you understand how to translate the bot's commands and messages into different languages.

## Guidelines for Translating

1. **Consistency**: Ensure that the translation is consistent with the original meaning. If you're unsure about the context, feel free to ask for clarification in the [Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/2rjCRKZsBb).

2. **Application Command Names and Options**:

   - **No Uppercase**: Command and options names (names only) should not contain uppercase letters.
   - **No Spaces**: Command and options names (only "names") should not contain spaces. Use underscores `_` or hyphens `-` if necessary.

3. **Proofreading**: Some languages are initially translated using AI. These translations need to be proofread and corrected to ensure accuracy and naturalness. Check tasklists on crowdin page for languages that needs proofreading

## Translation Process

Translations for our Discord bot are managed via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/skyhelper). Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. **Join the Crowdin Project**:

   - Visit our Crowdin project page [here](https://crowdin.com/project/skyhelper).
   - Create a Crowdin account if you don't have one.
   - Join the project as a translator or proofreader for your desired language.

2. **Select Your Language**:

   - Once you have joined the project, select the language you want to translate from the list of available languages.

3. **Translate Strings**:

   - Navigate to the list of strings that need translation.
   - Click on a string to open the translation editor.
   - Enter your translation following the guidelines mentioned above.

4. **Proofread**:

   - If you are proofreading, review the translations carefully.
   - Correct any errors or unnatural phrasing in the AI-generated translations.

5. **Submit Translations**:
   - After translating or proofreading, submit your translations.

## No Deadline

This project depends on the contributions of the community and I understand the importance of time, so there's no deadline. Do not feel pressure to complete it in a particular timeframe, do it whenever you want, take however long you want and if you don't feel like it, you can stop. I'll be notified when a translation completes, so I'll make sure to add it.

## Tips for Translating

- Maintain the original formatting and placeholders (e.g., `{{TIME}}`, `{{DURATION}}`), these should not be translated and are meant to be a placeholder for stuffs that are added based on the context.
- Test your translations if possible to ensure they fit well within the application context.
