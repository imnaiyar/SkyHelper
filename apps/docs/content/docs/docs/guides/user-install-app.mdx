# User-installable App

Discord has recently introduced a feature that allows users to install bots directly to their user accounts. This enables you to access the bot's commands across all Discord contexts: direct messages (DMs), group DMs (GDMs), and even servers where the bot isn't a member.

SkyHelper fully supports user installations, allowing you to use nearly all its commands seamlessly. However, some commands require the bot to be present in a server to function correctly. For details on which commands are server-specific, please refer to the [Commands](/docs/commands) page.

## Benefits of User Installation

- **Universal Access**: Use SkyHelper commands in any Discord context
- **Direct Messages**: Get Sky information privately without needing a server
- **Group DMs**: Share Sky content with friends in group conversations
- **Server Independence**: Use commands even in servers where SkyHelper isn't added

## How to Install SkyHelper

Adding SkyHelper to your user account is quick and easy, similar to adding it to a serverâ€”though the process slightly differs. Follow these steps:

<Steps>

## Managing Your Installation

4. Modifying or removing permissions as needed

## Troubleshooting

**Commands not appearing?**
