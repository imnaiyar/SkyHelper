# Linked Role Connection

Linked roles are a special type of role that allows users to acquire a role on their own if they meet specific requirements. SkyHelper supports Discord's Linked Role feature, enabling users to display their Sky: Children of the Light profile information directly on Discord.

## What are Linked Roles?

For example, if your server requires users to have their Reddit account connected to obtain a role, any user with Reddit linked can automatically acquire the role through the `Linked Role` option in the server settings.

The requirements can also be set for specific applications, provided they support linked roles. In our case, SkyHelper supports linked role connections, allowing users to showcase their Sky: Children of the Light profile on Discord.

For an in-depth explanation of linked roles, check out Discord's [official article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8063233404823).

## How Does It Work with SkyHelper?

When you set up linked roles, the chosen connection (in this case, SkyHelper) can update a user's connection details. Discord then uses these details to display relevant information on the user's profile.

SkyHelper leverages this feature to show a brief Sky: Children of the Light profile, displaying information such as:

- Player preferences and status
- Sky profile information
- Connection verification

To use this feature, users first need to authenticate with SkyHelper. After authentication, they will be prompted to set their preferences. Once their preferences are set and they have acquired the role, their Sky profile will be visible within the server.
