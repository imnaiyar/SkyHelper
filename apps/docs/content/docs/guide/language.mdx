# Language Support

Use SkyHelper in your own language! The bot supports multiple languages, so you can interact with it in the language you're most comfortable with.

## How It Works

SkyHelper can show responses in different languages:

- All bot messages translated
- Command responses in your language
- Help text localized
- Interactive elements translated
- Natural, fluent translations

**[Image Placeholder: Bot response in different languages]**

## Setting Your Language

### Personal Language

Set your own language preference:

- Choose any supported language
- Affects only your interactions
- Works across all servers
- Easy to change anytime

Your personal language setting follows you everywhere you use the bot!

### Server Language

Server admins can set a default language:

- Sets the language for the whole server
- New members see this language
- Members can still override with personal preference
- Requires Manage Server permission

**[Image Placeholder: Language selection interface]**

## Language Priority

The bot decides which language to use:

1. **Your Personal Language** (highest priority)
   - If you've set a language, it's always used

2. **Server Language**
   - If you haven't set one, server language is used

3. **English** (default)
   - If nothing is set, English is shown

<Callout type="info">
  Your personal language always wins! Even if a server has a different language set, you'll see your chosen language.
</Callout>

## Using Different Languages

### For Individual Users

Want the bot in your language?

1. Decide which language you prefer

4. Change it anytime you want

You can try different languages to see which you like best!

### For Server Admins

Want your server in a specific language?

1. Consider your community's language
2. Set it as the server default
3. Members see it unless they override
4. Helps non-English communities

### For Multilingual Servers

Have members speaking different languages?

- Set a server default for the majority
- Members can set personal languages
- Everyone sees their preferred language
- System handles it automatically!

<Callout type="tip">
  Multilingual servers work great! Set a server default, but encourage members to set personal preferences if different.
</Callout>

## Community Translations

### How Translations Happen

All translations are community-powered:

- Volunteers translate the bot
- Native speakers ensure accuracy
- Community reviews submissions
- Quality improves over time

<Callout type="info">
  **Help Translate!** SkyHelper needs volunteer translators. [Learn how to contribute](/docs/guides/translating) and help make the bot available in more languages!
</Callout>

### Translation Quality

Because translations are volunteer-made:

- Quality varies by language
- Some languages more complete than others
- Native speakers provide best accuracy
- Improvements happen regularly

### Reporting Translation Issues

Found a translation error?

- Note the incorrect text
- Explain what's wrong
- Suggest the correct translation
- Report through the bot

Or contribute directly to fix it yourself!

## Fallback Behavior

### Partial Translations

When content isn't translated:

- Untranslated text shows in English
- Page may mix translated and English text
- More translations added over time
- Experience improves gradually

### Missing Languages

If your language isn't available yet:

- Bot responds in English
- Language won't appear in options
- You can help add it!
- Check translation guide for how

## Language Tips

<Callout type="tip">
  **Try Before Committing**: Test a language with a simple command first to see if translations work well for you.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Be Patient**: Not everything may be translated yet. It's normal to see some English mixed in.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Help Improve**: If you spot translation issues, report them! Your feedback helps everyone.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Switch Anytime**: You're not locked in. Change languages whenever you want to try something different.
