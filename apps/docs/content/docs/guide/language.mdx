  languages!](/docs/guides/translating)

## Language Priority

The bot uses a priority system to determine which language to use:

<Steps>

<Step>

#### 1. User Language (Highest Priority)

If you've set a personal language with `/language set category:User`, this is used.

</Step>

<Step>

#### 2. Server Language

If no user language is set, the server's configured language is used (if set).

</Step>

<Step>

#### 3. English (Default)

If neither user nor server language is set, English is used.

</Step>

</Steps>

**Priority Flow**:

```
User Language → Server Language → English (Default)
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Override System**: Your personal language setting always overrides the server setting. This lets you use your preferred
  language even in servers with different defaults.
</Callout>

</Callout>

## Server Language Setup

### For Server Administrators

#### Determine Server Language

Consider your server's primary language or majority preference.

</Step>

<Step>

#### Set Server Language

Requires **Manage Server** permission.

**[Image Placeholder: Server language announcement]**

### Multilingual Servers

For servers with multiple languages:

<Callout type="tip">
  **User Choice**: Set a server default (majority language) but encourage members to set their personal language if different. The
  priority system handles this seamlessly!
</Callout>

## Use Cases

### Personal Preference

<Steps>

<Step>

You speak Spanish and want all bot responses in Spanish.

</Step>

<Step>

```
/language set category:User language:Spanish
```

</Step>

<Step>

All bot interactions are now in Spanish, regardless of server settings.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Regional Server

<Steps>

<Step>

You run a French Sky community server.

</Step>

<Step>

```
/language set category:Server language:French
```

</Step>

<Step>

All members see French by default unless they set personal preference.

</Step>

</Steps>

### International Server

<Steps>

<Step>

Your server has members from many countries.

</Step>

<Step>

Keep server language as English (default).

</Step>

<Step>

Members set personal languages as needed.

</Step>

<Step>

Everyone sees bot responses in their preferred language.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Translation Quality

### Community-Powered

<Callout type="info">
  **Volunteer Translators**: All translations are provided by community volunteers. Quality and completeness vary by language.
</Callout>

### Reporting Issues

If you notice translation errors:

<Steps>

<Step>

Note the incorrect translation and context.

</Step>

<Step>

Use `/utils contact-us` to report the issue.

</Step>

<Step>

Or contribute directly via the [translation guide](/docs/guides/translating).

</Step>

</Steps>

</Step>

<Step>

#### See Your Work Live

Your translations help users worldwide!

</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Native Speakers Needed**: We especially need native speakers to ensure accurate, natural translations. [Learn how to
  contribute](/docs/guides/translating)!
</Callout>

## Fallback Behavior

### Partial Translations

When content isn't translated:

- **Fallback to English**: Untranslated strings show in English
- **Mixed Content**: Page may have both translated and English text
- **Progressive Enhancement**: As translations are added, more content appears in your language

### Missing Languages

If a language isn't supported yet:

- Bot responds in English
- Language option won't appear in selection menu
- [Contribute to add the language](/docs/guides/translating)

<Callout type="info">**Growing Support**: New languages are regularly added based on community contributions and demand.</Callout>

## Best Practices

### For Users

<Callout type="tip">
  **Set and Forget**: Once you set your language preference, it persists across all servers. No need to configure it multiple
  times!
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Test First**: Try the language setting with a simple command like `/help` to see if the translations work well for you.
</Callout>

### For Server Admins

<Callout type="tip">
  **Survey Members**: Before setting a server language, survey your members to choose the most appropriate default.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Inform Members**: When changing server language, announce it and remind users they can override with personal settings.
</Callout>

### For Multilingual Communities

<Callout type="tip">
  **Embrace Diversity**: Don't force one language. Use the priority system to let users choose while having a sensible server
  default.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Language Not Changing

<Steps>

<Step>

#### Verify Command Success

Check if the command executed successfully (you should see a confirmation).

</Step>

<Step>

#### Check Category

Ensure you used the right category (User vs Server).

</Step>

<Step>

#### Test with Command

Run a simple command like `/help` to see the language.

</Step>

<Step>

#### Clear and Reset

If stuck, remove language and set it again.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Partial Translation

<Callout type="info">
  **Expected Behavior**: Some content may still appear in English if not yet translated for your language. This is normal and
  improves over time.
</Callout>

### Server Language Not Working

- **Permission Check**: Setting server language requires Manage Server permission
- **User Override**: Your personal language overrides server setting (this is by design)
- **Verification**: Ask another member without personal language to test

## Future Enhancements

Planned language features:

- More supported languages
- Complete translation coverage
- Context-aware translations
- Regional variants (e.g., US vs UK English)
- Translation management dashboard

<Callout type="info">
  **Help Shape the Future**: Your feedback and contributions directly influence which languages and features are prioritized!
