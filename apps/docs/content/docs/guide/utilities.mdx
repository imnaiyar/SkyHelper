# Utilities

SkyHelper includes several helpful utilities to make your Discord and Sky experience more convenient and enjoyable.

## Timestamp Converter

Create Discord timestamps that automatically adjust to everyone's timezone - perfect for coordinating events!

### What It Does

Converts any date and time into Discord's timestamp format. When you share it:

- Shows the correct time for everyone's timezone
- Displays in their preferred format
- No timezone confusion
- Works globally

### How to Use It

Provide your time information:

- Time of day (hours, minutes, seconds)
- Optional date (day, month, year)
- Optional timezone (defaults to America/Los_Angeles)

The bot gives you multiple Discord timestamp formats to choose from!
