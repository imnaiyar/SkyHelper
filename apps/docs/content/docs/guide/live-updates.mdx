# Live Updates

Keep your server constantly informed with auto-updating messages! Live updates show real-time shard and event information that refreshes automatically, no commands needed.

<Callout type="error">
  **Server Feature**: Live updates only work in Discord servers (not DMs) and require Manage Server permissions to set up.
</Callout>

## What are Live Updates?

Imagine having a message in your server that always shows current information - no need to run commands repeatedly. That's what live updates provide:

- **Auto-Refresh**: Updates every few minutes automatically
- **Always Current**: Shows latest countdowns and info
- **Set and Forget**: Works on its own once configured
- **No Spam**: One message that updates, not repeated commands

**[Image Placeholder: Live-updating message showing real-time info]**

## Two Types of Live Updates

### Live Shard Information

Get constantly updated shard details:

- Current shard type and location
- Countdown to next occurrence
- Full daily timeline
- Location guide access
- Updates every **5 minutes**

**[Image Placeholder: Live shard message with countdown]**

Perfect for servers focused on shard collecting!

### Live Event Schedule

Show all Sky events in real-time:

- All tracked events listed
- Countdown for each event
- Daily schedules
- Interactive event details
- Updates every **2 minutes**

**[Image Placeholder: Live events message with multiple countdowns]**

Ideal for keeping your community informed about everything happening in Sky!

## How It Works

### Simple Setup

Getting started is straightforward:

1. Choose what you want (shards or events)
2. Pick a channel for the live message
3. Bot creates the message and webhook
4. Automatic updates begin immediately

**[Image Placeholder: Setup process]**

The bot handles all the technical stuff - you just choose where you want the information.

### Automatic Updates

Once running:

- Message updates on schedule (2-5 minute intervals)
- Countdowns decrease in real-time
- Information stays fresh
- Interactive buttons remain functional
- No maintenance needed

### What Gets Updated

**For Shards:**

- Shard type for current date
- Location information
- Next occurrence countdown
- Timeline status (past/upcoming)
- Last updated timestamp

**For Events:**

- All event countdowns
- Schedule changes
- Status indicators
- Event details
- Refresh timestamps

## Setting Up Your Server

### Channel Recommendations

**Read-Only Channels**

Best practice is making live update channels read-only:

- Members can view but not send messages
- Prevents chat clutter
- Keeps live message visible
- Professional appearance

**Channel Naming**

Clear names help members understand:

- `#live-shards` - Shard updates
- `#live-events` - Event schedule
- `#sky-info` - Combined information

**Organization**

Use categories to organize:

```
ðŸ“Š Sky Live Info
  â”œâ”€â”€ #live-shards
  â”œâ”€â”€ #live-events
  â””â”€â”€ #event-chat (for discussion)
```

**[Image Placeholder: Organized channel structure]**

### Permission Setup

For optimal performance:

- **Members**: View channel only
- **Bot**: View, send messages, manage webhooks
- **Admins**: All permissions

This prevents accidental disruptions.

## Managing Live Updates

### One Per Type

You can have:

- One live shard update per server
- One live event update per server
- Both can be in the same or different channels

Starting a new live update automatically stops the previous one of that type.

### Updating Configuration

To change channels:

1. Stop the current live update
2. Start it in the new channel
3. Old message stops updating
4. New message begins

### Viewing Active Updates

Check if live updates are running:

- Look for the message in the channel
- Check the "last updated" timestamp
- Verify it's refreshing on schedule

## Best Practices

<Callout type="info">
  **Pin the Message**: Pin live update messages so they're always easy to find at the top of the channel.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  **Channel Description**: Add a description explaining the channel's purpose and update frequency.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  **Combine with Reminders**: Use live updates for passive tracking and reminders for active notifications.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  **Mobile Convenience**: On mobile, pin the channel to your favorites for quick access to current info.
</Callout>

## Technical Details

### Update Frequency

- **Shard Live**: Every 5 minutes
- **Events Live**: Every 2 minutes

These intervals balance freshness with Discord API limits.

### Webhook System

Live updates use webhooks:

- Bot creates "SkyHelper Live Updates" webhook
- Messages sent through webhook
- Persists through bot restarts
- Reliable delivery

<Callout type="warn">
  If the webhook or message gets deleted, live updates stop automatically. Simply set it up again to resume.
</Callout>

### Permissions Required

Must have:

- **You**: Manage Server permission
- **Bot**: Manage Webhooks in the channel

## Troubleshooting

### Updates Not Refreshing

If the message stops updating:

1. Check the "last updated" timestamp
2. Verify webhook still exists
3. Confirm bot has permissions
4. Try stopping and restarting

### Message Deleted

If someone deletes the message:

- Live updates stop automatically
- No error occurs
- Simply set it up again
- New message will begin updating

### Wrong Channel

To move to a different channel:

- Stop the live update
- Start it in the correct channel
- Old message becomes static
- New message is live
