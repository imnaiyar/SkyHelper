Each feature guide includes:

- **Overview**: What the feature does and why it's useful

- **Options**: Detailed explanation of all available options
- **Visual Examples**: Screenshots and demonstrations (when available)
- **Tips & Tricks**: Best practices and helpful hints

<Callout type="tip">
  **Pro Tip**: Most commands support the `[hide]` option to make responses visible only to you (ephemeral). This is useful in busy
  channels!
</Callout>

## Command Basics

<Callout>
  **Command Reference**:
  - **Required options**: Enclosed in `<` `>` are required, e.g., `<date>`
  - **Optional options**: Enclosed in `[` `]` are optional, e.g., `[timezone]`
</Callout>

## User-Install vs Server Commands

Most SkyHelper commands work in both:

- **User installations**: Install to your account and use anywhere
- **Server installations**: Added to a specific Discord server

However, some features require server installation:

- **Live Updates** (`/shards-live`, `/skytimes-live`)
- **Reminders** (`/reminders`)

These server-specific commands use webhooks and require the bot to be a server member.

## Getting Help

If you need assistance:

- Use `/help` command for quick command reference
- Use `/help command:<command-name>` for specific command help
- Use `/utils contact-us` to reach the development team
- Visit the [Discord support server](https://discord.gg/skyhelper)
