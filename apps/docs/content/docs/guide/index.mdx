### Server vs User Features

Most features work anywhere, but some require servers:

- **Work Everywhere**: Shards, Events, Spirits, Seasonal, Planner, Games, Utilities, Language
- **Server Only**: Live Updates, Reminders (need Manage Server permission)

<Callout type="warn">
  Server features require the bot to be added to the server and you need Manage Server permissions to set them up.
