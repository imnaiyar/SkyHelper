## Daily Quests Feature

### How It Works

  Database](https://discord.gg/skyinfographicsdatabase) community. Special thanks to Clement, io, and all content creators!
</Callout>

The daily quests feature:

1. **Monitors Infographics**: Bot watches for daily quest guides
2. **Auto-Captures**: Saves guides when posted

### Important Notes

<Callout type="warning">
  **Timing Variance**: Guides are created by humans and may be posted later than usual or not at all on rare occasions. Typically,
  there's a 1-2 hour grace period after reset.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Alternative**: If daily quest guides aren't available, check the infographics server directly or use `/skytimes` for general
  event info.
</Callout>

## Traveling Spirit Feature

When a traveling spirit is active or upcoming:

1. **Schedule**: Arrival and departure dates
2. **Spirit Details**: Name and type (when revealed)
3. **Items**: Cosmetics and emotes tree (when revealed)
4. **Cost Information**: Hearts and candles needed

### Revelation Status

<Callout type="info">
  Traveling spirit details are manually updated in the database when officially revealed. Before revelation, only the schedule is
  shown.
</Callout>

### Planning Your Purchase

- **Priority Items**: Decide what to get based on hearts available
- **Return Estimates**: Approximate next visit timeframe

## Tips & Tricks

  **Set Up Reminders**: Use the [Reminders](/guide/reminders) feature to get notified before events happen. Perfect for not
  missing Geyser or Grandma!
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Use Live Updates**: Set up [Live Updates](/guide/live-updates) for auto-refreshing event displays in your server channels.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">**Daily Routine**: Check `/daily-quests` every day after reset to plan your candle run efficiently.</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">**Weekend Planning**: Use `/skytimes` on Saturday to prepare for Eden reset on Sunday.</Callout>
