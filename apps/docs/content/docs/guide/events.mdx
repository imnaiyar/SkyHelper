## How It Works

### Real-Time Countdowns

All event times include live countdowns showing exactly how much time remains. Times automatically convert to your timezone based on your Discord settings, so you never have to do timezone math!

### Interactive Event Details

Click on any event to see its complete schedule for the day. This helps you plan your Sky sessions around multiple events.

### Refresh Anytime

A refresh button lets you update all the countdowns and times instantly without running the command again. Perfect when you've had the info open for a while!

## Community-Powered Quest Guides

The daily quest guides come from dedicated community creators:

- **Real Infographics**: Actual screenshots and visual guides
- **Clear Instructions**: Easy-to-follow quest walkthroughs
- **Updated Daily**: Fresh guides after each reset
- **Seasonal Content**: Includes seasonal candles when applicable

<Callout type="warning">
  Since guides are created by humans, they may occasionally be posted later than usual or not at all. The bot typically has a 1-2 hour grace period after reset for guides to appear.

## Traveling Spirit Information

When a traveling spirit is revealed, you get complete details:

- **Spirit Identity**: Which spirit from which season
- **Items Available**: Full friendship tree with all cosmetics
- **Costs**: Exactly how many candles and hearts you'll need

This helps you decide what to buy and plan your resources accordingly.

SkyHelper takes the guesswork out of tracking these patterns.
