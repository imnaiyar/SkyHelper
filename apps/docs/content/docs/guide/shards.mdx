# Shards Tracking

Never miss collecting shards again! SkyHelper provides real-time shard information, helping you know exactly when and where shards appear in Sky.

**Commands**: `/shard`, `/shard calendar`

### Track Current Shards

Get instant information about today's shard - its type, location, and when it will appear next. The bot shows you:

- **Current shard type** - Know if it's a Red Shard, Black Shard, or another type
- **Location details** - Exactly where in Sky the shard appears (Thanks to Clement and io)
- **Shards data** - By Gale
- **Next occurrence time** - Countdown to when it shows up next
- **Full day schedule** - All times the shard appears throughout the day

  The bot automatically shows information for today's date, but you can check any date if you're planning ahead by providing the
  `date` option. The date option accepts date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format and max input is `275760-09-12`!

### View Monthly Calendar

See the entire month's shard schedule at a glance. The calendar shows:

- All shards for each day of the month
- Quick overview of shard types and locations
- Easy navigation between months and years
- Visual layout making it simple to plan your shard collection

The calendar is interactive - you can navigate to any month or year to see past or future shard schedules.

<Callout type="info">You can navigate Â±5 years from the current year using the calendar's year selector.</Callout>
