  **Plan Ahead**: Use the calendar to plan your shard collection for the week or month. This helps you schedule your Sky time more
  efficiently.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Save Location Guides**: Screenshot or bookmark location guides for shards you frequently miss. This makes it quicker to find
  them next time.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Use Ephemeral Responses**: In busy channels, use the `hide:true` option to avoid cluttering the chat with shard lookups.

## Common Use Cases

### Daily Shard Check

Every day, use `/shards` to quickly see today's shard details and plan your collection time.

### Planning for Rare Shards

Use `/shards-calendar` to identify rare or specific shard types across the month and mark your calendar.

### Sharing with Friends

Use `/shards` without the `hide` option to share shard information with your server members.

### Historical Lookup

Need to know what shard was active on a past date? Use `/shards date:DD-MM-YYYY` to look it up.

## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warning">**Date Format**: Always use DD-MM-YYYY format (e.g., 22-07-2024). Other formats won't work.</Callout>

  **Timezone**: All times are automatically converted to your local timezone based on your Discord settings.
