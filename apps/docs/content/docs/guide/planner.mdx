# Sky Game Planner

Explore everything Sky has to offer in one interactive place! The planner lets you browse spirits, items, events, shops, and more with powerful filtering and search.

## What is the Planner?

Think of it as an interactive encyclopedia for Sky. Instead of searching through multiple sources, everything you need to know about the game is organized and accessible in one place.

You can browse:

- All spirits and their friendship trees
- Every cosmetic item in the game
- In-game events and their schedules
- All shops and what they sell
- Game realms and their areas
- Past and current seasons
