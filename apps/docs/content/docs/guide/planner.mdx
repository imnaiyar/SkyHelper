# Sky Game Planner

The Sky Game Planner is an interactive Discord bot feature that provides comprehensive access to Sky: Children of the Light game data. It allows you to browse spirits, items, events, shops, realms, seasons, track and plan you Sky progress directly through the bot.

## Credits and Compatibility

This planner is based on [Sky Planner](https://sky-planner.com) by Silverfeelin and uses its game data. It is fully compatible with the website, allowing you to import and export saved data seamlessly between the bot and the website.

## How to Use It

You can also use the `/planner` command for additional functionality:

- `/planner home` - Opens the planner home screen
- `/planner search <query>` - Search for specific content and jump directly to it
- `/planner profile` - View your planner profile and progress
- `/planner data <action>` - Import, export, or delete your planner data

## Interactive Features

The planner uses Discord buttons for navigation. From the home screen, you can:

- Browse different categories (Spirits, Items, Events, Shops, Realms, Seasons, Winged Lights)
- Filter content by various criteria
- Track your progress (unlocked items, currencies, etc.)
- View detailed information about any entity
- Navigate between related content

### Smart Navigation

The planner remembers your path:

1. Browse to Spirits → Forest Realm → Meditating Monastic
2. View their friendship tree
3. Click an item for details
4. Use back button to return to tree
5. Go back again to Forest spirits list

  This is valid only for 1-level back due to the nature of how your choices are stored and discord limitations.

## Data Management

### Importing Data

If you have saved data from the SkyGame Planner website or or the bot's, you can import it using `/planner data import`. This allows you to transfer your progress between platforms.

### Exporting Data

Export your current planner data using `/planner data export` to back up your progress. You can use these either on [Sky Planner](https://sky-planner.com) (since it is compatible) or the bot.

### Deleting Data

Use `/planner data delete` to permanently remove all your planner data from the bot.
