# Seasonal Content

Make the most of every Sky season! SkyHelper helps you plan your seasonal journey, calculate what you need, and ensure you get the items you want before the season ends.

## What You Can Do

### Calculate Your Season Completion

Know exactly if you can finish the season in time. The calculator tells you:

- **Days Needed**: How many days to get everything you want
- **Completion Date**: When you'll finish at your current pace
- **Candles Required**: Total seasonal candles needed
- **Feasibility Check**: Whether it's possible before season ends

**[Image Placeholder: Seasonal calculator showing completion timeline]**

Input your current seasonal candles and select which items you want - the bot does all the math!

<Callout type="info">
  The calculator considers your progress, daily candle income, and time remaining to give you accurate predictions.
</Callout>

### Interactive Item Selection

Choose exactly what you want from the season:

- **Browse All Items**: See every cosmetic available
- **Mark What You Own**: Exclude items you already have
- **Select Your Wants**: Pick only the items you're interested in
- **Real-Time Updates**: Watch the cost and timeline adjust as you select

## How Seasonal Planning Works

### Understanding the Calculator

The bot calculates based on:

1. **Your Current Candles**: How many seasonal candles you have now
2. **Today's Dailies**: Whether you've completed today's quests
3. **Season Pass Status**: If you have the pass (extra candles per day)
4. **Selected Items**: Which cosmetics you want to buy

It then shows if you'll finish in time and by what date.

<Callout type="warn">
  The calculator assumes you'll complete dailies every remaining day. Missing days will affect your timeline!
</Callout>

### Season Pass Consideration

The season pass provides:

- More seasonal candles per day
- Exclusive cosmetics
- Faster progression
- Special perks

The calculator adjusts its predictions based on whether you have it, helping you decide if it's worth getting.

### Daily Candle Income

What the calculator counts:

- **6 Seasonal Candles**: From daily quests (everyone)
- **Pass Bonus**: Extra candles if you have the pass
- **Seasonal Quests**: Additional candles from season missions

## Planning Your Season

### Early Season Strategy

At the start of a new season:

1. **Run the Calculator**: See what's possible with your playtime
2. **Identify Must-Haves**: Choose your favorite items
3. **Make a Budget**: Decide if you need the pass
4. **Plan Your Path**: Know which spirits to unlock first

### Mid-Season Check-In

Halfway through:

1. **Update the Calculator**: Input current candles
2. **Verify Progress**: Ensure you're on track
3. **Adjust Plans**: Change item selection if needed
4. **Stay Motivated**: See how close you are

### End-Season Rush

In the final week:

1. **Final Calculation**: See what's still achievable
2. **Prioritize**: Focus on must-have items only
3. **Skip Non-Essentials**: Let go of items you can live without
4. **Finish Strong**: Complete in time

## Making Season Decisions

### When to Get the Pass

Consider the season pass if:

- You want exclusive pass items
- You need faster progression
- You have limited playtime
- You want to support the game

Use the calculator to see if the pass makes your goals achievable.

### Item Prioritization

Choose items based on:

- **Personal Taste**: What you'll actually use
- **Rarity**: Items that might not return soon
- **Cost Efficiency**: Good value for candles
- **Completion Sets**: Matching cosmetic collections

<Callout type="info">
  You don't need to get everything! Focus on items you truly want. Many seasonal items return later as traveling spirit offerings.
</Callout>

## Understanding Seasonal Candles

Seasonal candles are special currency:

- **Earned from Seasonal Quests**: Daily seasonal activities
- **Limited to Season Duration**: Only available during the season
- **Used for Seasonal Items**: Required for season cosmetics
- **Don't Carry Over**: Any unused candles are lost after season

Plan accordingly so you don't waste candles or miss items!

## After the Season

What happens when a season ends:

- **Spirits Become Travelers**: They'll visit on rotation
- **Items Cost Regular Candles**: No more seasonal candles needed
- **No Time Pressure**: Take your time when they return
- **Same Friendship Trees**: Items remain the same

<Callout type="info">
  Missed something? Don't worry! Seasonal content eventually returns as traveling spirits. You can get most items later.

## Tips for Season Success

<Callout type="info">
  **Start Early**: Begin seasonal content in the first week. This gives you maximum time and flexibility.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  **Daily Consistency**: Complete seasonal quests every day. Missing even a few days can make completion impossible.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  **Use the Calculator Weekly**: Re-run the calculator each week to stay informed about your progress and adjust plans.

  **Prioritize Hearts**: If a seasonal spirit has heart-locked items, get those first. Hearts are harder to obtain than candles.
