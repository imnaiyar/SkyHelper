## Tips & Tricks

### Calculator Optimization

<Callout type="tip">
  **Run Calculator Early**: Use the calculator at the start of each season to plan your approach. This helps you decide if the
  season pass is worth it.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Update Regularly**: Re-run the calculator weekly to adjust for changes in your progress and ensure you're on track.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">**Prioritize Favorites**: Select only the items you really want. You don't need everything!</Callout>

### Season Completion Strategy

<Steps>

<Step>

#### Week 1: Planning

- Run seasonal calculator
- Identify must-have items
- Create shopping list
- Decide on season pass

</Step>

<Step>

#### Weeks 2-8: Grinding

- Complete daily quests every day
- Focus on seasonal candles
- Unlock spirits in priority order
- Track progress weekly

</Step>

<Step>

#### Final Week: Finishing

- Use calculator to verify completion
- Get remaining items
- Don't miss time-limited exclusives
- Complete any unfinished quests

</Step>

</Steps>

### Daily Routine

For efficient seasonal progression:

1. **Complete Daily Quests**: 6 seasonal candles
2. **Do Seasonal Quests**: Additional candles
3. **Unlock Priority Spirits**: Get favorites first
4. **Save for Ultimate Gifts**: Don't spend all candles immediately

<Callout type="warning">
  **Don't Wait**: Start seasonal content early. Waiting until the last week often means you won't have time to complete
  everything.
</Callout>

## Cost Optimization

### Smart Spending

<Callout type="tip">
  **Hearts First**: If a spirit has both candle and heart items, unlock heart items first. Hearts are harder to get and don't
  carry over to next season.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">**Essential Items Only**: Focus on items you'll actually use. Completionism can be expensive!</Callout>

### When to Skip Items

Consider skipping items if:

- You won't use them
- They're cosmetically similar to items you have
- You need to save for ultimate gifts
- The season pass would be required
