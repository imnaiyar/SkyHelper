## Tips & Tricks

### Hangman Strategy

<Callout type="tip">
  **Common Letters First**: Start with common letters like E, A, T, O, I, N before trying less common ones.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Word Length Clues**: The number of blanks helps narrow down possibilities. A 10-letter word is likely a spirit name!
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">**Sky Knowledge**: The more you know about Sky, the better. Study spirit names, realms, and items.</Callout>

### Scrambled Strategy

<Callout type="tip">**Eliminate Impossible**: If you see "TGH" together, it's likely part of "LIGHT" or "FLIGHT".</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">**Work Backwards**: Know the word length and think of Sky words that fit.</Callout>
