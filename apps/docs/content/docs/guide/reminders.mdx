# Reminders

Never miss important Sky events again! Set up automated reminders that notify your Discord server when events are about to happen or are starting.

<Callout type="error">
  **Server Feature**: Reminders only work in Discord servers (not DMs) and require you to have Manage Server permissions to set them up.

## How Reminders Work

### Simple Setup

Setting up a reminder is easy:

1. Choose which event you want reminders for
2. Select a channel where notifications will appear
3. Optionally pick a role to ping
4. Done! The bot handles the rest

**[Image Placeholder: Reminder setup interface]**

The bot creates a webhook in your chosen channel and uses it to send reminder messages when events happen.

### Automatic Notifications

Once set up, reminders work automatically:

- Bot monitors event schedules
- Sends notifications at the right time
- Includes relevant event information
- Pings your chosen role (if you set one)

### Role Pinging

You can configure role pings for each event:

- **With Role Ping**: Mentioned users get a notification
- **Without Role**: Just a channel message, no pings
- **Per-Event Control**: Different roles for different events

<Callout type="info">
  Create opt-in roles like @GeyserHunters or @SpiritCollectors so users can choose which reminders they want!
</Callout>

## Managing Your Reminders

### Check Status

See all configured reminders in your server:

- Which events have reminders
- Where notifications are sent
- Which roles are pinged
- When they were set up

**[Image Placeholder: Reminders status overview]**

### Update Settings

Need to change something? Simply set it up again:

- Change the channel: Set with new channel
- Update the role: Set with different role
- Modify anything: New setup replaces old

### Stop Reminders

Don't want reminders for an event anymore? Stop them anytime. The bot will remove that reminder and stop sending notifications.

## Organizing Reminders

### Channel Strategy

Different approaches for different communities:

**Dedicated Channels**

Create specific channels for each event type:

- `#geyser-alerts` - Just geyser reminders
- `#spirit-visits` - Traveling spirit notifications
- `#daily-reminders` - Daily reset and quests

**Combined Channel**

Use one channel for all reminders:

- `#sky-reminders` - All events in one place
- Simpler for small servers
- Everything in one location

**Priority-Based**

Separate by importance:

- `#important-events` - Traveling Spirit, Grandma
- `#regular-events` - Geyser, Daily Reset

**[Image Placeholder: Different channel organization examples]**

### Role Strategies

**Event-Specific Roles**

- `@Geyser Fans` - Only geyser alerts
- `@Grandma Squad` - Just Grandma visits
- `@Spirit Collectors` - Traveling spirits

**Tier System**

- `@All Events` - Every reminder
- `@Important Only` - Just special/limited events
- `@Daily Stuff` - Resets and daily activities

**Opt-In Approach**

Make roles self-assignable:

- Users choose their own notifications
- No unwanted pings
- Better engagement

## Best Practices

<Callout type="info">
  **Start with Important Events**: Begin by setting up reminders for events you really don't want to miss, like Traveling Spirit and Grandma.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  **Use Clear Names**: Name channels descriptively like `#sky-geyser-alerts` so everyone knows what notifications to expect there.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  **Don't Over-Ping**: Reserve role pings for truly important or time-sensitive events. Too many pings lead to people muting.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  **Regular Cleanup**: Review your reminders occasionally and remove ones your community doesn't use.
</Callout>

## Common Setups

### For Casual Communities

Simple setup for casual players:

- Traveling Spirit reminder with @everyone ping
- Grandma reminder (no ping)
- Daily Reset reminder (no ping)

### For Active Communities

Full setup for dedicated players:

- All events configured
- Dedicated channels for each type
- Specific roles for opt-in notifications
- Organized with category folders

### For Competitive Groups

Focused on efficiency:

- Geyser and Grandma with role pings
- Eden reset with @everyone ping
- Daily quests (no ping, info only)
- Coordinated group activities

## Technical Details

### Webhook System

Reminders use Discord webhooks:

- Bot creates "SkyHelper Reminders" webhook
- Sends messages through the webhook
- Works even if bot appears offline temporarily
- Reliable notification delivery

<Callout type="warn">
  Don't delete the "SkyHelper Reminders" webhook! If deleted, reminders for that event will automatically stop.
</Callout>

### Permissions Required

For reminders to work:

- You need: **Manage Server** permission
- Bot needs: **Manage Webhooks** in the channel

Without these, reminder setup will fail.

## Troubleshooting

### Reminders Not Working

If reminders stop:

1. Check the webhook still exists
2. Verify bot has Manage Webhooks permission
3. Confirm reminder is still configured (check status)
4. Try stopping and setting up again

### Role Not Being Pinged

If the role isn't mentioned:

- Ensure role is mentionable (or bot can mention any role)
- Check role is configured in reminder settings
- Verify role wasn't deleted

## Alternative: Dashboard
