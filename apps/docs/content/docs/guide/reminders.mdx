- Geyser eruptions
- Grandma visits
- Daily resets
- Eden/weekly resets

- And more!

## How Reminders Work

### Setup Process

<Steps>

<Step>

#### Configure Event

Run the configure command with your chosen event and channel.

</Step>

<Step>

#### Bot Creates Webhook

The bot automatically creates a webhook in the specified channel.

</Step>

<Step>

#### Reminder Scheduled

The reminder is scheduled based on the event's timing.

</Step>

<Step>

#### Notification Sent

When the event occurs, a reminder message is sent via webhook.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Reminder Message

Each reminder includes:

- **Event Name**: Which event is happening
- **Event Time**: When it's occurring
- **Role Ping**: If configured
- **Additional Info**: Relevant details about the event
- **Quick Links**: Related guides or information

**[Image Placeholder: Example reminder message]**

### Role Pinging

<Callout type="info">
  Role pings are optional but recommended for important events. Users can opt-in to be notified by joining the specified role.
</Callout>

When to use role pings:

- **Always**: For limited-time events (Traveling Spirit, Grandma)
- **Usually**: For recurring events (Geyser, Turtle)
- **Sometimes**: For routine events (Daily Reset)
- **Rarely**: For very frequent events

## Configuration Tips

### Channel Organization

<Steps>

<Step>

#### Dedicated Event Channels

Create specific channels for different event types:

- `#geyser-alerts`
- `#spirit-visits`
- `#daily-resets`

</Step>

<Step>

#### Combined Events Channel

Or use one `#sky-reminders` channel for all events.

</Step>

<Step>

#### Priority Channels

Separate critical events from routine ones:

- `#important-events` → Traveling Spirit, Grandma
- `#regular-events` → Geyser, Daily Reset

</Step>

</Steps>

### Role Strategy

<Steps>

<Step>

#### Event-Specific Roles

Create roles for each event type:

- `@Geyser Hunters`
- `@Grandma Visitors`
- `@Spirit Collectors`

</Step>

<Step>

#### Tier System

Organize by importance:

- `@All Events` → Everything
- `@Important Only` → Traveling Spirit, Grandma
- `@Daily Activities` → Resets and quests

</Step>

<Step>

#### Opt-In System

Make roles self-assignable so users choose their notifications.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Managing Reminders

### Updating Configuration

<Callout type="info">
  To change the channel or role for an event, simply run the configure command again with your new preferences. The old
  configuration will be updated.
</Callout>

**Example**:

```
/reminders configure event:Geyser channel:#new-channel role:@NewRole
```

Updates Geyser reminders to new channel and role.

### Multiple Events

You can configure reminders for multiple events:

<Steps>

<Step>

Configure Geyser reminders

</Step>

<Step>

Configure Grandma reminders

</Step>

<Step>

Configure Traveling Spirit reminders

</Step>

<Step>

Each operates independently

</Step>

</Steps>

### Checking Status

Use `/reminders status` to:

- See all active reminders
- Verify channel assignments
- Confirm role configurations
- Identify missing reminders

**[Image Placeholder: Status overview]**

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
  **Start with Important Events**: Begin by configuring reminders for events you don't want to miss, like Traveling Spirit and
  Grandma.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Use Clear Channel Names**: Name channels descriptively (e.g., `#sky-geyser-alerts`) so users know what notifications to
  expect.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Limit Role Pings**: Don't ping roles for every event. Reserve pings for truly important or time-sensitive events.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Regular Cleanup**: Periodically review and stop reminders for events your community doesn't participate in.
</Callout>

## Common Setups

### Casual Community

For casual Sky players:

```
/reminders configure event:Traveling Spirit channel:#events role:@Everyone
/reminders configure event:Grandma channel:#events
/reminders configure event:Daily Reset channel:#events
```

### Active Community

For dedicated players:

```
/reminders configure event:Geyser channel:#geyser role:@Geyser
/reminders configure event:Grandma channel:#grandma role:@Collectors
/reminders configure event:Traveling Spirit channel:#spirits role:@Everyone
/reminders configure event:Daily Reset channel:#daily role:@Dailies

```

### Hardcore Community

For very active communities:

- Dedicated channels for each event
- Specific roles for each activity
- All events configured
- Multiple reminder channels organized by priority

## Webhook Management

### How Webhooks Work

The bot uses webhooks to send reminders:

<Steps>

<Step>

Bot creates a webhook in your chosen channel

</Step>

<Step>

Webhook is named "SkyHelper Reminders"

</Step>

<Step>

Bot uses webhook to post reminder messages

</Step>

<Step>

Webhooks persist even if bot goes offline temporarily

</Step>

</Steps>

### Webhook Permissions

<Callout type="error">
  The bot must have **Manage Webhooks** permission in the channel. Without it, reminder setup will fail.
</Callout>

### If Webhook is Deleted

<Callout type="warning">
  **Auto-Disable**: If the webhook is manually deleted, reminders for that event are automatically disabled. Reconfigure to
  re-enable.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Reminders Not Working

<Steps>

<Step>

#### Check Permissions

Verify bot has **Manage Webhooks** in the channel.

</Step>

<Step>

#### Verify Configuration

Run `/reminders status` to confirm setup.

</Step>

<Step>

#### Check Webhook

Look for "SkyHelper Reminders" webhook in channel settings.

</Step>

<Step>

#### Reconfigure

If issues persist, stop and reconfigure the reminder.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Role Not Pinging

- Verify role is mentionable (or bot has permission to mention any role)
- Check role configuration in `/reminders status`
- Ensure role exists and wasn't deleted

### Wrong Channel

Simply reconfigure with the correct channel:

```
/reminders configure event:Geyser channel:#correct-channel
```

## Alternative: Dashboard

<Callout type="info">
  Reminders can also be managed via the [bot dashboard](https://dash.skyhelper.xyz) for a visual interface.
</Callout>

Dashboard advantages:

- Visual setup
- Bulk configuration
- Easy editing
- Status overview
- No Discord commands needed
