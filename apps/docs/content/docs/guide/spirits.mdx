## Understanding Spirit Currency

**Candles** üïØÔ∏è

- Earned daily from collecting light
- Used for most spirit items
- Easier to obtain in larger quantities

**Hearts** ‚ù§Ô∏è

- Earned by trading candles with friends or completing quests
- Required for premium items
- More valuable and harder to get
- Worth planning for in advance

**Seasonal Candles** üß° (Active seasons only)

- Earned from daily seasonal quests
- Only during active seasons
- Become regular candles for traveling spirits later

<Callout type="info">
  Hearts are the limiting factor for most players. Plan which spirits' heart-locked items you want most!

## Tips for Spirit Collecting

<Callout type="tip">
  **Hearts First**: When unlocking a spirit's tree, prioritize heart-locked items. Hearts are harder to get, so secure those items first.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Seasonal Priority**: During active seasons, focus on seasonal spirits. You can get regular spirits anytime, but seasonal ones have limited availability.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Use Partial Names**: Save time by searching with just part of a spirit's name. The bot's fuzzy search will find what you're looking for.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Check Trees Before Buying**: Always review the full friendship tree before starting to unlock. You might discover items you want deeper in the tree.
