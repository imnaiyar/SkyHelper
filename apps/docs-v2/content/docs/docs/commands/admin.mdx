# Admin Commands

Almost all commands under this category are related to features providing live updates and/or reminders.

<Callout type="error">
  All commands in this category are only available for servers (not user installations) and require users to have `Manage Server`
  permissions (Admins) to use them. These commands are also not visible to users who lack the permission (this behavior can be
  adjusted under `Server Settings > Integrations Tab`, although there's also an internal check for permissions, so enabling it for
  users without the necessary permission will still prevent them from using it).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  All commands in this category require the bot to have the `Manage Webhooks` permission in the channel where you are attempting
  to add the "updates" feature.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">The features in this category can also be managed via bot's [dashboard](https://dash.skyhelper.xyz)</Callout>
